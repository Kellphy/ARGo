  CommunityDescription: The C++ community is rather smaller, comprising of approximately
    15 members. Most of the members are senior programmers and consultants and are
    very involved in their projects. Hence, they find themselves little to no time
    to get involved in the community activities.
  CommunityHighlights: "  - Confluence articles for knowledge sharing\r\n  - Online
    courses and trainings"

  CommunityLeadInfo: Stefan Cosmin Cretu joined Endava in the second half of September
    2021, as a development consultant. His previous experience in the local IT market
    consists of maintaining and developing C++ software applications running on Linux
    or Unix based systems, envisaged for embedded industry, such as automotive and
    networking. I discovered C++ programming and OOP concepts in the 2nd year of
    my Bachelor's studies, at the Faculty of Automated Control in Bucharest. Since
    then I've been working to broaden my knowledge in this area, mainly in a self-taught
    fashion. Additionally, I am looking to use this knowledge to grasp the particularities
    of existing projects, as well as to propose solution designs for software products
    that are in developmental phase. That is why I have a constant tendency to dig
    into project's details, so to get acquainted to the control flow or with the
    requirements and I cherish the existence of good documentation that depict this
    information. Mainly, I developed this habbit during my Master's studies in Software
    Engineering, at the University of Groningen.
