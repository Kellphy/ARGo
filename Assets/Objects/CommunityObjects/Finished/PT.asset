  CommunityDescription: We're a group of around 15 people (half junior, half senior)
    actively doing performance testing as their main role, plus a number of other
    colleagues wanting to learn more about this area. We're trying to keep the group
    active and together as a community by having recurrent meetings and communicate
    with each other often, and at the same time grow by recruiting and teaching more
    juniour colleagues continuously.

  CommunityLeadInfo: Has been with Endava for 6 years now, working on 5 projects.
    He bagan his performance testing career 9 years ago, when ""someone in the team
    had to pick up performance and security testing skills"". Turned out it wasn't
    as straight forward with the security testing, but performance testing was manageable
    for a novice.  Now he splits his time between doing performance testing on various
    projects, career coaching, leading the performance testing community in BHD,
    and participating in pre sales activities occasionally.
